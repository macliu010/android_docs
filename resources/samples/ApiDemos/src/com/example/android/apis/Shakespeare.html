            "Unless to spy my shadow in the sun" + 
            "And descant on mine own deformity:" + 
            "And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover," + 
            "To entertain these fair well-spoken days," + 
            "I am determined to prove a villain" + 
            "And hate the idle pleasures of these days." + 
            "Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous," + 
            "By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams," + 
            "To set my brother Clarence and the king" + 
            "In deadly hate the one against the other:" +

            "Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here" + 
            "Clarence comes.",

            "To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else," + 
            "it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and" +

            "dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with" + 
            "the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject" + 
            "to the same diseases, healed by the same means," + 
            "warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as" +

            "revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will" + 
            "resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian," + 
            "what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian" + 
            "wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by" + 
            "Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you" + 
            "teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I" + 
            "will better the instruction.",

            "Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus" + 
            "or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which" + 
            "our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant" + 
            "nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up" + 
            "thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or" + 
            "distract it with many, either to have it sterile" + 
            "with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the" + 
            "power and corrigible authority of this lies in our" + 
            "wills. If the balance of our lives had not one" + 
            "scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the" + 
            "blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us" + 
            "to most preposterous conclusions: but we have" + 
            "reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal" + 
            "stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that" + 
            "you call love to be a sect or scion.",

            "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!" + 
            "You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout" + 
            "Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!" + 
            "You sulphurous and thought-executing fires," +

            "Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder," + 
            "Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!" + 
            "Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once," +
